# x86-Assembly-Snake
A very simple implementation of Snake using x86 Assembly and using the Irvine32 library

Note: make32 will most probably not work. I made this using Visual Studio 2013 and you can follow the instruction at Irvine's website to set up the project. There is a blank project file there as well which you can use and simply copy this code.

I wrote this to be very intuitive and very easy to understand (as such is my coding style). I was supposed to make this as a semester project for my assembly language class and it was actually pretty easy.

Enjoy! Oh, and if you ever find this helpful or if this helped you pass the class, you can send me an email at MegamanEXE[at]live.com to thank me :) It will mean a lot!
